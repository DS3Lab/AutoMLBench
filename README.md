# AutoMLBench

We conduct a benchmark over several popular AutoML platforms --- 
Google Could AutoML, Amazon AWS Autopilot, Azure Automated ML and Oracle Data Science.
For reproducibility, we make all datasets and code public.

- [Dataset](dataset.md)
- Code. We provide jupyter scripts for three platforms. Note that Google does training and inference without any code.
    - AWS: code/aws_sagemaker
    - Azure: code/azure
    - Oracle: code/oracle_datascience
- Configurations: please refer to our paper: XXX.
